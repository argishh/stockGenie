# stockGinie

A price prediction application using PyTorch LSTM, trained on live stock price data and deployed using Streamlit.

## Features
- Real-time stock price data fetching
- Live model training & prediction
- Interactive visualizations
- Model performance metrics

## Installation
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Testing
```bash
pytest tests/
```
